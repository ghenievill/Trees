FAMILY TREE MANAGER APPLICATIONS 

# Introduction:
    The Family Tree Manager is a simple Java program that helps you manage and view a family tree. It lets you add family members, display the family tree, search for members, and delete members from the tree.    

# What It Can Do:
    Add Family Member: You can add a new family member. You can choose to add them as the root of the tree or under another family member as their child.
    Display Family Tree: You can see the whole family tree. It shows members in a hierarchy, with children listed under their parents.
    Search for a Member: You can search for a family member by name. If they are found, the program shows their name and their children (if they have any).
    Delete a Member: You can remove a family member from the tree by name. If the member is the root, the whole tree is deleted. If they are not the root, the member and their children are removed.
    Exit: You can exit the program whenever you want.

# Why I Made This Application:
    I made this application to help people organize their family history. And give a simple way to track family members.

# How It Helps Me and the Community:
    ▪︎For me: This application allows me to practice and helps me at my own pace, especially with things like trees and recursion. It also gives me a chance to practice handling user input and creating simple programs, which I find helpful as I continue learning and getting better.
    ▪︎For the community: This tool can help people organize and visualize their family history. It could be useful for anyone who wants to keep track of their family members
